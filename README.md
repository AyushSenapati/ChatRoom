# ChatRoom
As the name suggests, it is a chatting application, built using Python3.
I have created this repository, so that I can learn SocketProgramming, MultiThreading,
GUI Programming using Tkinter, CodeManagement etc.
I am thinking of implementing web version of this too, so that I can learn Django as well.

This repository contains chatServer.py, which is the main server application.
Client application has not been added yet, but will be added soon.
