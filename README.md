# ChatRoom
As the name suggests, it is a chatting application, built using Python3. I have created this repository, so that I can learn SocketProgramming, MultiThreading, GUI Programming using Tkinter, CodeManagement etc. I am thinking of implementing web version of this too, so that I can learn Django as well.
